# 2D-experience-game
First 2D project, trying to learn about 2D game development using Unity

# Objective
Develop a simple 2D game, using Unity, to learn about the basics of the engine

# Game Setup
The game proposal is to be similar to the Dino Chrome, the game present on Google Chrome when the user is offline. The desired setup is to emulate it's behaviour, adding a few more features and polishment to learn about the engine possibilities.

# Configurations
The machine used to develop this game was a Acer Nitro 5, with a Intel I7 7700H processor, a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050Ti and 16Gb of RAM. The Unity version used was the 5.0 one

# Feedback
This is my first 2D project (I have also developed a 3D game, that is going to be refactored before it's upload to Git), so any feedbacks and suggestions are apreciated. All I ask is respect :)
